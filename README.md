# VBA-Challenge

As my first real coding exercise, this challenge was a crash course in 'thinking like a computer' and applying the respective logic.

This repository contains the Excel files with my VBA script that analyzes real stock market data. It was written to loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume.

- The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"


The script also contains conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.
